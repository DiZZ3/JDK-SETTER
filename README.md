# JDK-SETTER

This Batch file will let you choose which java version you want to use.
It does this by changing your JAVA_HOME system variable.



## [Make sure to follow this tutorial if you have not already created your JAVA_HOME.](https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-1)




### [Follow this guide to add/remove Java versions to the batch file]



**If you dont know what your doing please to not attempt to mess with the code of this batch file as it can mess up your system variables and possibly damage your computer.**

**By downloading this batch file you agree that i will not be held liable for any damages.** 



I will be posting a video soon on how to expand the batch file to allow the choice of other versions of java.
Also, might implement some auto detection when it comes to java versions and add UI so that noobs can use it as well.
